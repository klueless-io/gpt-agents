          "prompt": "You are tasked with creating a compelling YouTube outro that will seamlessly transition from the current video to the next, increasing watch time and viewer engagement. Your goal is to analyze the content of the current video and create guidelines for a transition that incorporates the topic of the next video.\n\nFirst, carefully read the abridgment of the current video:\n\n<current_video_abridgement>  \n[current_video_abridgement]  \n</current_video_abridgement>\n\nNow, consider the topic of the next video:\n\n<next_video_goal>  \n{{next_video_goal}}  \n</next_video_goal>\n\nAnalyze the content of the current video abridgment and identify 2-3 key themes or main points. These will serve as potential connection points to the next video.\n\nNext, create guidelines for a transition using the following three-step framework:\n\n1. **The Bridge:** Identify a way to connect one of the key themes from the current video to the topic of the next video. This should feel like a natural progression or extension of the current content, ensuring the next video is seen as a logical continuation.\n\n2. **Curiosity Hook:** Develop an intriguing statement or question directly tied to the next video's topic that will pique the viewer's interest. This should hint at valuable information or insights that the viewer doesnâ€™t yet know but would want to learn, creating anticipation for the next video.\n\n3. **Promise of Transformation:** Craft a compelling promise about what the viewer will gain from watching the next video. This should address a desire or need of the target audience, making the next video feel essential for achieving a specific outcome or understanding.\n\nPresent your analysis and transition guidelines in the following format:\n\n# Key Themes  \n1. [First key theme from current video]  \n2. [Second key theme from current video]  \n3. [Third key theme from current video (if applicable)]  \n</key_themes>\n\n# Bridge  \n[Guidelines for connecting a key theme to the next video topic]\n\n# Curiosity Hook  \n[Guidelines for creating an intriguing statement or question directly related to the next video]\n\n# Transformation Promise  \n[Guidelines for crafting a compelling promise about the next video]\n\nEnsure that your guidelines are specific enough to guide the creation of an engaging outro, but flexible enough to allow for creative expression in the final script.\n",
