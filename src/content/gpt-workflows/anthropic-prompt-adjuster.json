They should be introduced with a clear label like Cleaned Output and no brackets around the output text.\n- If you have multple outputs then then each output should just be a heading with colon followed by the output\n\n\nExample Structure:\n\n- For input, retain token formatting but modify it to [name_of_input] and surround it with the correct tags. Add a label such as **Input** to introduce the text.\n- For output, provide the cleaned-up text with no tokens, introduced by a simple label such as **Cleaned Output**.\n\nFinal Instruction Cleanup:\n\n- Modify lines like \"Now, please clean up the provided text...\" so they are concise and clear. Remove any references to tokens in outputs and end the instruction with a colon and label the section clearly.\n\nHere is the prompt to transform:\n\n<anthropic_prompt>\n[anthropic_prompt]\n</anthropic_prompt>\n\nPlease write the transformed prompt in a code block:\n",
