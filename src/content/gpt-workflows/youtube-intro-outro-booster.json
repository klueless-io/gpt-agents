          "prompt": "You are tasked with suggesting appropriate YouTube video intro hooks based on a given scenario.\n\nYour goal is to analyze the scenario and recommend 3 hook types that would be most effective for engaging viewers.\n\nHere are ten different types of intro styles often used by successful YouTube channels to hook viewers right away: \n\n1. The Question Hook: Start with a thought-provoking or curiosity-inducing question.\n2. The What-If Scenario: Pose a hypothetical situation that grabs attention and sparks the imagination.\n3. The Bold Statement: Begin with a surprising or bold claim that challenges expectations or knowledge.\n4. The Challenge: Present a challenge that encourages viewers to see if they can do it or overcome it by watching the video.\n5. The Relatable Problem: Highlight a common problem or frustration the audience faces, followed by a promise to solve it.\n6. The Teaser: Hint at something exciting or valuable that's coming later in the video, but don't reveal it yet.\n7. The Story Intro: Start by telling a quick, personal, or relatable story to draw in viewers emotionally.\n8. The Demonstration: Immediately show something in action—something that will intrigue viewers and make them want to learn how it was done.\n9. The Stat or Fact Hook: Use an interesting or shocking statistic or fact to capture attention.\n10. The Controversial Take: Open with a contrarian or unpopular opinion to spark debate and curiosity.\n\nNow, consider the goal of the YouTube video and the intro scenario: \n\n<current_video_goal>\n[current_video_goal]\n</current_video_goal>\n\n<intro_scenario>\n[intro_scenario]\n</intro_scenario>\n\nAnalyze the given scenario and select the 3 most appropriate hook types from the list above.\nFor each selected hook type, provide a brief explanation of why it would be effective for this particular video scenario.\nAfter presenting your 3 recommended hook types with explanations, provide a short list of the other hook types that were not selected, in case the content creator prefers a different style.\n\nPresent your response in the following format:\n\n[Hook Type Name 1]\n\n[Explanation of why this hook type is appropriate for the scenario]\n\n---\n\n[Hook Type Name 2]\n\n[Explanation of why this hook type is appropriate for the scenario]\n\n---\n\n[Hook Type Name 3]\n\n[Explanation of why this hook type is appropriate for the scenario]\n\n[List of the remaining hook types not selected] \n\nEnsure that your explanations are concise yet informative, directly relating the hook type to the specific elements of the given scenario.\n",
